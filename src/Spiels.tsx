  "The Trip": {
    Conception: `
    These songs started to come together during lockdown. The lyrics in the Trip came together organically; in the first verse James is looking back to when he and his now wife Taylor would take walks in the woods together when they first got together; the second verse moves on to talk about a trip they made by boat to Amsterdam and their experience sailing, the frost on the boat and what it was like looking out to the port as they drew closer to the city. The third verse begins to talk about grief, which is an overarching theme of this set of songs. <br /> <br />

    James lost his grandfather during this time and this song begins to touch on James’s experience with grief. Grieving is a lonely thing and despite having the love and support from family and friends it is something everyone has to go through on their own one way or another, which significantly magnified by the social restrictions which were in place at the time. <br /> <br />
    
    Musically, the songs were inspired by jazz music from the ‘30s and ‘40s, particularly the music of Louis , incorporating the rich textures of 7th chords and discord but within the format a pop song, with the result being like a begotten nostalgia for a bygone era for a type of music that didn’t really exist at the time, and for years that we never experienced ourselves.

    Recording: `
    For a short collection of tunes, recording took place over a number of different locations and over a long period of time, albeit with long gaps between dates and production work, what with life getting in the way. <br /> <br />

    Initial tracking was done at James’s house in September ’22, recording his piano. The piano in question is part of Polite Young Gentlemen legend; James was having a washing machine delivered by a man with a van, whose previous job had been to clear out someone’s house, which included this piano which was offered to and purchased by James for the tidy sum of £15. <br /> <br />
    
    The piano has a natural, honky tonk-esque warble which we have always been fans of and James has written most of his recent work it so it was only natural that we would want to build the tracks around this piano sound.<br /> <br />

  "Coffee Cup Baby": {
    Conception: `
    This song follows along similar lines of the first musically speaking. The idea for the chords and music came first when James wanted to write a song in the old jazz AABA format, so having a big lead in, verses, a middle 8 and then a lead out section which was the guitar solo and it contains musical references to the Inkspots. <br /> <br />

    The lyrical inspiration came when James was listening to these old romantic jazz songs and found that some of the lyrics hadn’t aged particularly well and infact sound a bit creepy – things like “She’s 16 and she’s sweet” being sung by a man in his 40s have lost a bit of their shine and he didn’t want to go down that route. So he came up with the idea to subvert this concept and came up with the idea of a guy seeing a girl, thinking she’s beautiful and getting her name off of the cup of coffee she’s carrying. <br /> <br />

    The middle 8 takes a darker twist and indicates the narrators feelings are veer into an obsession and hinting at coercive and controlling tendencies, evoking the dynamic of a celebrity / stalker relationship, raising the question; is this guy OK? <br /> <br />

    Recording: `
    Recording continued at my flat in Yoker. I was in the middle of moving house at the time and found that the mostly empty property provided peak Glasgow tenement acoustics vibes. Stone walls, wooden floors; all very lively sounding. This was in the run up to Christmas ’22 and at that point the piano recordings from September had been edited into basic tracks but then life got in the way and work had halted on the songs until this opportunity presented itself. <br /> <br />

    So I messaged James and suggested we set up to record the vocals at the flat, which we did of an evening, in the middle of winter. <br /> <br />

    I’d already moved all the recording kit out of the house so we had to carry out a reverse break-in and lug the same recording kit which had been carefully packed up and moved out to my new flat, back in through the living room window of the old flat for our makeshift recording session. <br /> <br />

    We set up a few mics in the flat; one for James to sing to directly, one further back in the living room, one out in the hall and then one pointed a corner of the living room ceiling which had a bit of an interesting flutter echo type response. <br /> <br />

    This meant that James could play with dynamics and the acoustics of the space in his performances and use the room itself as an instrument, which is particularly evident in this song where the verses catch the full power and volume of his voice in the room(s) and then drop down to the staccato bridge section which is almost spoken. 
    <br /> <br />

    We decided to add drums to the recordings almost as an afterthought. I have played a bit of drums over the years but never was as seriously dedicated to it as I was to the guitar. During lockdown I took to learning the drums for a while and would go down to Carlton some mornings to play along with various tunes. <br /> <br />

    I had quite a specific idea for the sound and the feel of the drums, again along similar lines to the inspiration for the music. We wanted to get an ambient drum sound, similar to recordings from the ‘40s and feel wise I wanted them to sit quite far behind the beat – so far behind the beat its almost falling into the previous hit.
    <br /> <br />

    We spent a lot of time working out the sort of tone and style that we wanted for the guitar solo at the end, taking a more melodic, methodical and thoughtful approach. There was a lot of trial and error for this section during rehearsals when James first brought the song in and the solo on the recording was put together virtually note by note in the days running up to recording with this in mind, playing off of the chords and the rhythms in the song. <br /> <br />

  "That Night": {
    Conception: `This song is sticks out thematically from the other songs in the collection; it doesn’t follow a verse-chorus structure and its more direct and melancholic. <br /> <br />

    The music and lyrics for this song came at the same time. James wrote the lyrics as a stream of conscious recollection of the night his grandfather passed away. The words tumble out evocatively; they are deadpan and abstract, conjuring up indirect images and little details of his recollection of the night. <br /> <br />
    
    Musically it doesn’t contain a huge top melody and the chords underneath don’t follow conventional movements. 
    It’s more spoke-sung akin to something by Nick Cave, bringing attention to the words. The images stick, the feeling of driving there and knowing that something’s not quite right, seeing his name on the door and then seeing someone you love pass away but being in the room and seeing in from outside. It’s a dry, plaintive retelling of the events of the night in an almost conversational tone, like an inner monologue rationalising something traumatic that has happened. <br /> <br />
    
    The song carries the weight of grief; it’s heavy and it doesn’t contain any hooks in the conventional sense; nothing lingers in the song. Dynamically, it begins as a whisper, tense and quiet before building dynamically and adding layers before erupting with the piano life at the emotional heart of the piece before dropping down and tailing off at the end. <br /> <br />

    Recording: `This was the last song that we worked on during the vocal session at the flat in Yoker. James did one take of it at the time but given that it was after a fairly long shift recording we weren’t sure if it was “the one” and vaguely made plans to come back to it again. It was only after listening back to it in the days following the session that we found it was a fairly potent and understated performance of the song and decided to keep it.
    <br /> <br />

    This song was left more stark than the others in terms of arrangement with more emphasis on ambient sounds to augment the song. The piano was recorded back through a studio monitor speaker when it was found to have a bit of ringing feedback. <br /> <br />
    
    Two guitar tracks were recorded for the track, one initially at Carlton studios and a subsequent take at my next flat in Shawlands. The idea for the guitar in this song is to use noise and feedback to underpin the emotion of the lyrics, which we though was interesting when set against their fairly deadpan reading by James. <br /> <br />

  "Weird Goodbye": {
    Conception: `The original plan had been to track three tunes for this release but James introduced a fourth on the day of initial piano recording. it seemed to tie together the themes and sound of the other songs and gave the set a grandiose, musical-esque finale to go out on, which became Weird Goodbye. <br /> <br />

    The lyrics are partly inspired by James’s previous work as a carer; it starts off from the point of view of someone with dementia and their experience of living in a care home and what their experience may be like towards end of life; not quite recognising people’s names and the environment that they’re in before segueing into a musing on the experience of death and the afterlife. <br /> <br />
    
    This song was written some time after the other songs and again touches on grief but in a way that has come to terms with it more. Anyone who has experienced loss will understand this, that the feeling of loss will continue and it will continue to hurt but it also becomes easier to live with. <br /> <br />
    `,
    Recording: `This one kicks off with a car horn beeping which interrupted the start of James’s vocal take in Yoker, which we thought was absolutely hilarious so we kept it in, obviously. <br /> <br />

    Musically, James wanted something more strident and bombastic than the other songs, with a greater sense of rhythm and movement, standing in contrast to the lyrics. We wanted the chorus section to underline this; the arrangement builds up with each round with voices joining in a call and response and a slide guitar playing around the melody before the piano rounds out the set playing the main theme. <br /> <br />
    
    We recorded some of these backing vocals in my kitchen at the old house in Huntly, with two mics set up so we could sing at the same time. I then layered up some more on top of these along with the slide guitar at my current house here, putting the total number of recording locations at five for anyone keeping score. <br /> <br />
